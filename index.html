                        <p class="mb-3">Hi, I am Kumar Baral. I am from Ilam. My fascination with engineeering is not an old one. I can still vividly recall the school day when I saw engineer wearing a white cap in building construction works near my home town. The engineer, supervising the workers and taking the responsibility of the construction works, was almost charismatic and glamorous in a way. The fact that engineer is the one with the most contribution to the society and the respect he gets from the people around him triggered my interest in the subject. I Joined undergraduate studies in Pulchowk Campus with scholarship in 2008.</p>
                        <p class="mb-3">After the completion of my undergraduate studies where I studied core engineering subjects. However, I was more gravitated toward Water Science and Engineering. So that, I joined a firm Hydro-consult Engineering Limited, which basically works on the field of water; water management, policies and majorly in hydropower development. </p>
                        <p class="mb-3">After  working there for few years, my curiosity increased more and I joined IHE Delft Institute of Water Education to acquire in-depth knowledge in Water Resource Engineering in 2018 in the Netherlands. There, I studied Hydrology, Hydraulics, Dam and Hydropower and Resource Management too. </p>
                            <p class="mb-3"> After being graduate of water resource engineering, 
                                I returned in Nepal an joined Hydro Plan Engineering Pvt. Ltd. 
                                After working there for 2 years, I again joined Hydro-Consult Engineering Limited.</p>

                            <p class="mb-0">Persuasion is achieved by the speaker's personal character when the speech is spoken as to make us think him credible. We believe good men more fully and more readily than others. This is true generally whatever the question is, and absolutely true where exact certainty is impossible and opinions are divided.</p>
